# <HW-01-ADV-CSS>

## Description

This repo is the second homework assignment, focusing on building a webiste in HTML and styling it with CSS to be user friendly across platforms.

This application required cross-platform planning as well as implementation of efficient code. The needs of a mobile site are very different from those of a desktop or tablet site.

Considerations included the placement of hyperlinks to be easy enough to find on a small screen while staying out of the way enough to not accidentally send users offsite.
